Testing Server and Client Code
When testing server and client parts of an application, the main goal is to ensure that all components behave as expected under different scenarios.

1. Server-Side Testing: This involves testing the server logic, such as request handling, database interactions, and API processing. You write unit tests for individual server functions and integration tests for the entire server behavior. For example, you might test how the server handles client requests or interacts with a database.

2. Client-Side Testing: On the client side, you test UI components, user interactions, and communication with the server. Unit tests verify individual functions, such as form validations, while integration tests check how the client interacts with the server. Mocking server responses is often used to simulate communication during client testing.

Using OpenCppCoverage for Code Coverage
OpenCppCoverage helps measure how much of your server and client code is tested. It provides coverage reports that show which lines of code were executed during testing.

1. How It Works: OpenCppCoverage instruments your server and client binaries to track which lines of code are executed during test runs. It generates a report showing the percentage of covered and uncovered code.

2. Coverage Report: The report shows coverage percentages, such as "Cover 78%" and "Uncover 22%", indicating which parts of the server or client code have been tested and which have not.

Improving Test Coverage
If you see a lot of uncovered code (e.g., 22% uncovered), you can improve testing by writing additional unit or integration tests to cover those parts, ensuring better validation of both server and client functionalities.
